```

```

***

### Users
After starting the app, a new user will be prompted to add onself to the database while an existing user will be prompted to enter their information to retrieve the current active job applications the app is tracking.

The user has the option to view and filter the jobs in the database, add/delete a job application, view and sort their own active applications, and update the application status to keep track of the important milestones.

### Admin
The admin manages the databases so the admin not only can view all the available jobs, but also can view/delete the active users and edit/delete a job posting.
